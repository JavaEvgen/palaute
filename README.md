#Feedback system

Third project made for school(but not a school project :D)

The project is made using Maven, Spring MVC and JdbcTemplate.

ReadFromExcel class reads through an excel file and automaticly writes all data needed to db.

A unique url generator for a specific course(admin choose what course) and mailSender that sends the url to
all participants.

When a participant presses the link, he will be redirected to a survey page for answering questions
(2 textareas and 4 multiple selection questions).

At the end of the survey the participant must provide a real student number for sending a comfirmation link(one-time url).

When the confirmation link is pressed, the feedback is published.

Keywords: Maven, Spring MVC, Spring Auth, password encoder, bean validation, one-time url.

Waiting for Your comments,
Thank You.
